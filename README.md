# Java / .NET Base Image

This repository contains everything for building and publishing a 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) base image intended for Java/.NET interoperation.

## Features

- .NET SDK 5.0
- OpenJDK 11

## Motivation

I use it as quick onboarding image for projects where  
Java and .NET environments in combination are needed.

So, it enables me to cherry pick the best from both worlds.

Read the [documentation](https://github.com/capjan/java-dotnet-base-image/wiki) and enjoy.
