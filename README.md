# Java / .NET Docker Base Image

This repository contains everything for building and publishing a 
Docker base image intended for Java/.NET interoperation.

I use it for a quick onboarding for projects where I need Java and 
.NET environments in the same service.

It enables me to cherry pick the best from both worlds.

Enjoy.
