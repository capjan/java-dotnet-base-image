# Java / .NET Docker Base Image

This repository contains everything for building and publishing a 
Docker base image intended for Java/.NET interoperation.

I use it for a quick onboarding image for projects where I need 
Java and .NET environments in combination.

So, it enables me to cherry pick the best from both worlds.

Read the [documentation](https://github.com/capjan/java-dotnet-base-image/wiki) and enjoy.
