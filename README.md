# Java / .NET Base Image

This repository contains everything needed for building and publishing a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) base image intended for Java/.NET interoperation.

## Features

- [Public image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/capjan/java-dotnet-base) at Docker Hub
- .NET SDK 5.0
- OpenJDK 11
- [Documentation](https://github.com/capjan/java-dotnet-base-image/wiki)

## Try it

Start the image at your own Docker Engine environment.

```bash
docker run --rm capjan/java-dotnet-base
```

## Motivation

I use it as quick onboarding image for projects where Java and .NET environments in combination are needed.

So, it enables me to cherry pick the best from both worlds.

Enjoy.
